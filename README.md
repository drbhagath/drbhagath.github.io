# Speech Processing for Low Resource Languages

Welcome to the repository for **Dr Bhagath P**. This project focuses on developing tools, techniques, and datasets for the analysis and synthesis of speech in underrepresented and low-resource languages.

## Objectives
- Enhance accessibility and inclusivity in speech technology.
- Develop algorithms optimized for low-resource settings.
- Build and share open-source datasets for low-resource languages.

## Features
- **Data Collection Pipelines**: Tools for efficient data collection and annotation.
- **Speech Recognition Models**: End-to-end ASR models tailored for low-resource languages.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems for creating high-quality audio outputs.
- **Language Resources**: Pre-trained models and datasets for various low-resource languages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (latest version)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/low-resource-speech-processing.git
cd low-resource-speech-processing

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
- **Training an ASR Model**:
  ```bash
  python train_asr.py --config configs/asr_config.yaml
  ```
- **Testing a Pre-trained Model**:
  ```bash
  python test_asr.py --model checkpoints/asr_model.pth --data test_data/
  ```
- **Synthesizing Speech**:
  ```bash
  python synthesize.py --text "Hello, world!" --language your_language_code
  ```
